Positive cash flow means more money is coming in than going out, which is healthy. Negative cash flow means the opposite. A Cash Flow Statement tracks this movement by categorizing it into three activities: Operating (day-to-day business), Investing (buying/selling assets), and Financing (borrowing/issuing shares).",

When a company needs to borrow money, instead of going to just one bank, it can borrow smaller amounts from many people (investors) by issuing debentures. It's essentially an 'I Owe You' from the company to the investor, promising to pay a fixed rate of interest periodically and repay the principal amount at a specified future date. Unlike shareholders, debenture holders are lenders, not owners.",

		  "A large infrastructure company issues '10% Secured Debentures of ₹1000 each' to the public to fund the construction of a new highway. This means they promise to pay 10% interest annually.",

They help to reduce the price of a good or service, making it more affordable for consumers or encouraging its production.",

It indicates the proportion of a company's financing that comes from debt versus equity. A high ratio suggests that the company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt, which can be risky. A low ratio indicates a more conservative financial structure. It shows the long-term financial soundness of a company.",

		  "If a company has long-term debt of ₹1,00,000 and shareholders' equity of ₹2,00,000, its Debt-Equity Ratio is 0.5:1. This means it has ₹0.5 of debt for every ₹1 of equity.",
		  "A ratio of 2:1 is generally considered risky, as it implies that debt is twice the amount of equity.",

The exchange rate is free to fluctuate and find its own equilibrium level. An increase in demand for the currency leads to 'appreciation', while a decrease in demand leads to 'depreciation'. Most major world currencies, including the US dollar, Euro, and Indian Rupee, operate under this system (though often with some intervention, known as a 'managed float').",

Instead, its capital structure is reorganized to write off accumulated losses and present a fairer view of its assets.

The amount 'sacrificed' by shareholders and creditors is used to write off fictitious assets and losses.",

The company grants employees the 'option' to buy a certain number of its shares at a pre-determined price (the 'exercise price'), after a specified period of time (the 'vesting period'). ESOPs are used to attract, retain, and motivate employees by aligning their interests with those of the shareholders. If the company does well and its share price goes up, the employees can make a profit by exercising their options.",

However, in a later paper (1963), they relaxed the no-tax assumption and showed that with corporate taxes, the value of a levered (debt-using) firm is higher than that of an unlevered firm by an amount equal to the present value of the 'tax shield' provided by debt.",

		"description": "The risk-return tradeoff is a fundamental principle of finance which states that higher potential returns on an investment are associated with higher risk. Risk is the degree of uncertainty about the actual return that will be earned. To entice investors to take on a higher level of risk, they must be compensated with the potential for a higher return. This principle guides investors in making decisions about how to allocate their capital based on their personal risk tolerance.",
		"examples": [
		  "Government bonds are considered very low-risk investments, and therefore, they offer a relatively low rate of return.",
		  "Equity shares (stocks) of a small startup company are very high-risk, but they offer the potential for very high returns if the company succeeds.",
